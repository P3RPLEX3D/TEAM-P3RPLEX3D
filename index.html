                <p>Let it be said, that I am by no means a professional writer. This website is likely to be filled
                    with grammer mistakes, run on sentences, rambles and rants about who knows what. To whoever reads
                    these words, let me say in advance. You were warned.</p>

                 <section class="header"><h2>Who I am</h2></section>
                <p>My name is Jacob, but for some reason I have been called "Jake" my entire life. I dont remember how old i was when i found out that those two names are completely different. I dont know a thing about sports and cant fix any vehicle that needs more than an alternator repair. I can fix a computer though.... </p>
                <p>Ive never been hunting in my life, but I've been fishing plenty. I tend to stay at home more than I go out.... ever. I like to play Dungeons and Dragons, and just about any moba or MMo on the market. Chances are, if you have ever played dungeons and dragons and it just wasnt "your thing", then we can never be friends..... Ever.</p>
