			<p><strong>9kingdoms RPG</strong> is a tabletop roleplaying game inspired by the vastly popular roleplaying games "Dungeons and Dragons" by <a class="links" href="https://company.wizards.com/" target="_blank">wizards of the coast</a> and "Rift's RPG" by <a id="rifts" class="links" href="https://palladiumbooks.com/" target="blank">Palladium Books</a>. Having spent more than 2 decades playing the roleplaying game genre style of gaming, I have come to greatly respect and admire these type of games and have decided that its time that I put my own spin on the ol d20 and create my own table top game for others to enjoy.</p>

				<p><strong>Rakar Wildhammer</strong> was a man of few words, but what he lacked in words he made up for in rage and brute strength. He was the largest member of his Takarian clan known as "The Iron-Bear", and One of the toughest Takarian to ever set foot on to what was known as a Dragonship. </p>
				<p class="paraeee"><strong>Midas Acceptir</strong> was stranger to no one, in fact all of his people knew him; either in person or by deed, as he was known to be the great commander that led his people across the treacherous waters to the new world. Kind and gentle hearted as he was, he would often open his feasts for all to enjoy.</p>
